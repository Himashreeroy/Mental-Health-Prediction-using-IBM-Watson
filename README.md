# Mental-Health-Prediction-using-IBM-Watson

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and early detection of mental health issues can significantly improve outcomes for individuals. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can identify potential mental health concerns based on various input features.
The project follows a data-driven approach, utilizing a dataset that includes a wide range of variables such as demographic information, lifestyle factors, social interactions, and self-reported mental health indicators. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, we aim to build a robust predictive system.
